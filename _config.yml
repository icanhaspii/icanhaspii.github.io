title: icanhaspii CTF STUFF
description: This project began in January of 2022 as a set of personal notes I started keeping to better organize my on-going learning. Some of the screenshots are from YouTube video demonstrations by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@_JohnHammond">John Hammond</a>, and are used with his permission (thank you, John!). Additionally, several of the techniques depicted are a direct by-product of following along with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@TCMSecurityAcademy">Alex Olsen</a> during his weekly streams (Alex, you are amazing!). A big note of thanks to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ippsec">IppSec</a> for his endless wealth of knowledge, and the kindness to share it. Another thanks goes to <a href="https://tomhessman.com">Tom Hessman</a> for his keen answers to my silly GitHub questions. A special thank you to <a href="https://github.com/rykergogo">Ryker Gogolkiewicz</a> for agreeing to tutor me, very last minute, on Markdown vs. HTML, and the odd way in which GitHub renders it all. Lastly, huge buckets of gratitude to <a href="https://wizardzines.com">Julia Evans</a> for allowing me to feature her incredible artwork as part of this CheatSheet! One final note, I'm not very happy with the way this site looks and works. I struggled with how HTML was rendering, so switched to Markown, but its still got some issues. That being said, I didn't want to allow perfection to be the enemy of good, so if you want the site in a PDF format, I'll have that out shortly.
