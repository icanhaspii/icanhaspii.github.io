description: This project began in January of 2022 as a set of personal notes I started keeping to better organize my on-going learning. Some of the screenshots are from YouTube video demonstrations by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@_JohnHammond">John Hammond</a>, and are used with his permission (thank you, John!).  Additionally, several of the techniques depicted are a direct by-product of following along with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@TCMSecurityAcademy">Alex Olsen</a> during his weekly streams (Alex, you are amazing!). A big note of thanks to IppSec for his endless wealth of knowledge, and the kindness to share it. Another thanks goes to Tom Hessman for his keen answers to my silly GitHub questions.  A special thank-you to <a href="https://github.com/rykergogo">Ryker Gogolkiewicz</a> for agreeing to tutor me, very last minute, on Markdown vs. HTML, and the odd way GitHub renders it all.  Lastly, huge buckets of gratitude to <a href="https://wizardzines.com">Julia Evans</a> for allowing me to feature her incredible artwork as part of this CheatSheet!
